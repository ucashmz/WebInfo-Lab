# Lab2

Two methods are provided in this project, the Bayes and the RNN.

To run any of them, you need to download `Stanford_core_nlp` from web and install `stanfordcorenlp` in pip. 

For RNN, you may also need to have `tensorflow(2.2.0)` and pretrained words embedding  `GloVe` (could be downloaded from web).
