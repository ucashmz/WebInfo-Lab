# Lab1



## Prerequisite

You may need to install `nltk`  before getting started

```
pip install nltk
nltk.download()
```

if `nltk.download()` doesn't work,  [this](https://blog.csdn.net/qiang12qiang12/article/details/81254595) may help.

`numpy` is also needed.

Test under Windows 10, but should be able to run under other OS.




## Guide

**You may need to change WORKPATH in config.py**

You may need `filename.csv`, `words.txt`, `inverted_table.csv`, `tfidf_table.csv` before doing a search. These files could be produced by the program.

Run `python src/bool_search.py` to start.
